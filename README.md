interactive tool for efficiency gap and wasted vote calculations

This codebase includes a fork of elm-plot that allows for stacked bars... explaining all the javascript. It's really an elm project, but without [the ability to reference local package dependencies](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-package/issues/87) in builds, I'm left copying around js. If you've got a better idea, let me know!
